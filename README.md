# Compiler_Mini_Matlab

&emsp; Compilers are essential software tools that bridge the gap between high-level programming languages and the low-level machine code executed by computers. They play a crucial role in translating human-readable code into efficient and executable instructions. Given the assignment of developing a compiler, our team has developed a compiler that can perform the same functions as a Matlab software. We have implemented some of the exact same functions from Matlab. Through developing this software, we hope to be able to create a software that is like Matlab and add even more functions into it, being able to easily customize it.
